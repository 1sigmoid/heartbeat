# Aim of this Project




# Setup and Pre-requisites

## Encouraged Practices
1. As this is a Data Science related project, the use of Jupyter Notebooks is encouraged, as it helps us to quickly analyze the data and the results.

2. However, it is required for all developers to store a copy of their code as a regular .py file in the releases folder, once a significant milestone in development has been reached



## Folder Structure

### Datasets - Absent (Not in repository, but required to run the code)
Make a folder called datasets in the root directory, and download two datasets from kaggle.

1 > https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge

2 > https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset

### Doc
All Documentation related to tests, scripts, code, API Syntaxes, must go here

### Src
All source code goes here


### tests
All unit tests go here. (Crucial for Fast Development and Testing


### Releases
Once a significant milestone in the development of the project has been reached, developers will provide a .py file for simplicity purposes, and to eliminate any redundant and test code that may be presesnt in the Jupyter Notebooks




# Running the Code
The code here can do lots of things. But we have to write it first
