# Aim of this Project
An Aim can be established once we start working on the project



# Setup and Pre-requisites

## Encouraged Practices
1. As this is a Data Science related project, the use of Jupyter Notebooks is encouraged, as it helps us to quickly analyze the data and the results.

2. However, it is required for all developers to store a copy of their code as a regular .py file in the releases folder, once a significant milestone in development has been reached

3. Every single function, class and object, MUST be documented using the best practices. Some guidelines are

```
def someFunction():
  """
  One Line summary of the function.
  
  A detailed description of the logic of the function.
  
  Paramenters: (A list of all variables, libraries, classes, objects etc used in the function)
  something (int): for this purpose
  somethingelse (string): for this purpose
  
  
  Return: (to specify what is going to be returned by this particular function)
  
"""
```

## Folder Structure

### Datasets - Absent (Not in repository, but required to run the code)
Make a folder called datasets in the root directory, and download two datasets from kaggle.

1 > https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge

2 > https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset

### Doc
All Documentation related to tests, scripts, code, API Syntaxes, must go here

### Src
All source code goes here


### Tests
All unit tests go here. (Crucial for Fast Development and Testing)


### Releases
Once a significant milestone in the development of the project has been reached, developers will provide a .py file for simplicity purposes, and to eliminate any redundant and test code that may be presesnt in the Jupyter Notebooks




# Running the Code
The code here can do lots of things. But we have to write it first
